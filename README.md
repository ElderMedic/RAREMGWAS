## Identification of Genetic Factors for Remission of Rheumatoid Arthritis

**A meta-analysis of genome-wide association study on RA remission**

### Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic, inflammatory autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the lining or synovium of the joints, is a complex polygenic disease with a complicated inheritance mode. Previous research has found various aspects of the genetic contribution to the etiology, pathogenesis, and outcome of RA. Rapid diagnosis and a treat-to-target treatment are effective in controlling the progression of the disease and reducing the chance of disability; although many patients can achieve remission, however, some individuals fail to respond adequately to treatment. To study the genetic effect on reaching RA (early) remission, we performed a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis combining multiple cohorts. We identified one significant disease-associated SNP and 13 SNPs showing suggestive associations; they are functional annotated, mapped to gene, and enriched for pathway analysis. We discovered the RA-associated gene CLEC16A, and the findings suggest a link between Cardiomyopathy and RA. With the expectation to aid precision medicine for different patients, our study provided a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
